# FC-system-with-Attendance-and-Temperature-Monitoring

Face recognition has become a popular technology which is mostly used for identification and authentication of a legitimate user based on the profile or features of the face of that user. There are several methods to identify or recognize a face, one of them being the LBPH(Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm which uses the extracted features from the face detection that are converted to grayscale and are then recognize.This methodology for face recognition is used in our project to identify the face of the students and mark their attendance accordingly in an automated manner which does not require any sort of human involvement.
Along with the Face recognition technology, our project comprises of three modules:

-->The Attendance system

-->Temperature monitoring 

-->Solenoid lock 

After integrating all the modules of the system it will work by capturing an image of all the authorized personnel and storing the information into our database along with the images by mapping it into a face coordinate structure. So, whenever a registered student enters the classroom our proposed system recognizes the person with the live video stream and marks their attendance along with their body temperature along with restricting the entry of the feverish individuals.

The key objectives of the project includes:

-->Ensuring that the student was genuinely present in class and also was in good health

-->Replacingthe physically-touched authentication systems

-->Decrement in human involvement for attendance marking and temperature monitoring
